The directory structure of this tests directory mirrors the directory structure
of the parent (production code) directory.

So, for example, unit tests for CIME/foo.py should live in
CIME/tests/test_foo.py, and unit tests for CIME/SystemTests/bar.py should live
in CIME/tests/SystemTests/test_bar.py.

There are a few methods you can use to run the unit tests here:

- From scripts/tests, run:
    ./scripts_regression_tests.py A_RunUnitTests

  This runs all of the doctests in CIME and the unit tests defined in
  this directory.

- From scripts/lib, run:
    python3 -m unittest discover -s CIME/tests -t .

  This runs all of the unit tests defined in this directory.

- From scripts/lib, run an individual test file, like:
    ./CIME/tests/test_user_mod_support.py
